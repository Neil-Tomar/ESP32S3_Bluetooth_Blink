## About

This project sets up a BLE server on the ESP32-S3 using the `NimBLE` library. The device advertises itself as `XIAO-LED`. When connected, you can send messages like `on` or `off` via BLE, and the ESP32 will control the LED accordingly.

---

## Features

- BLE server with custom service/characteristic
- Accepts write messages from BLE clients
- LED turns ON/OFF based on BLE message
- Serial monitor prints all received BLE data
- Simple Android app for control

---

## Requirements

- **Hardware**:
  - ESP32-S3 (e.g. Seeed Studio XIAO ESP32S3)
  - LED (or onboard LED on GPIO 2)

- **Software**:
  - VS Code + PlatformIO
  - MIT App Inventor (for Android app)

---

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```sh
‚ùØ git clone https://github.com/Neil-Tomar/ESP32S3_Bluetooth_LED
‚ùØ cd ESP32S3_Bluetooth_LED
```

2. Open in VS Code with PlatformIO

3. Connect ESP32-S3 via USB

4. Upload the code

5. Open Serial Monitor (Baud: `115200`)

---

## Usage

- Power on the ESP32-S3
- Open the custom Android app (see below)
- Connect to device named `XIAO-LED`
- Use ON/OFF buttons to send commands
- LED should respond immediately

BLE Commands:
- Send `on` ‚Üí LED ON
- Send `off` ‚Üí LED OFF

Serial Output Example:
```
BLE LED Ready
BLE Client Connected
Received: on
LED ON
```

## üîå How Bluetooth Works

- **BLE Server (ESP32)**: The ESP32 acts as a BLE server. It advertises a service with a unique UUID (`6e400001-b5a3-f393-e0a9-e50e24dcca9e`). Inside this service is a characteristic with UUID `abcd1234-5678-90ab-cdef-1234567890ab` that supports `WRITE` operations.

- **BLE Client (Android App)**: The Android app connects to the ESP32, locates the characteristic, and writes simple strings like `"on"` or `"off"` to control the LED.

- **Callbacks**: When data is written to the BLE characteristic, the ESP32 triggers a callback (`onWrite`) to parse the command. If `"on"` is found, the LED is turned ON. If `"off"` is found, it turns OFF.

- **Connection Events**: The code also logs when the BLE client connects or disconnects.

## MIT App Inventor App

This project includes a custom Android app made using [MIT App Inventor](https://appinventor.mit.edu/):

- Connects to BLE device `XIAO-LED`
- Sends text command `on` or `off` when buttons are pressed
- Simple UI with two buttons

You can export the `.aia` file and customize the app easily.
